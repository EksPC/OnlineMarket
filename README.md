#### DESCRIPTION
This is a simple client-server application developed in Java. Basically a client connects to a server via socket and, after a simple login,
the client is allowed to buy, return and upload products. The list of products is visible in the main screen and the navigation between section
is made with simple buttons.

It is my first "complete" project and i spent quite a few time on it and I really learnt how to use javafx, FXML files and sockets. 
However, I only implemented really basic and raw features, like a text-file database, a login interface without cryptography and
kind of inefficient algorithms for product-searching and a basic UI. 

I'm overall proud of my work but I'm looking to improve myself.
